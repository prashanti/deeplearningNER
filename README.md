## Ontology-powered Named Entity Recognition and Robust Semantic Similarity Metrics

The goal of this project is to develop novel natural langauge processing methods for recognizing ontology concepts from biological literature. Ontologies are computationally amenable forms of data representation that have made large scale biological analyses possible. Translating knowledge from scientific publications to an ontology-powered format still relies largely on manual curation of literature - a process that is unscalable and tedious. Advances pioneered by this project will enable knowledge discovery from scientific literature and power computational analyses to answer complex biological questions.
